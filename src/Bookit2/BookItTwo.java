         * My day to day activity:
         * My shift starts at 8am, first thing first I double check the results of my smoke
         * test, make sure that the application is up and running. Then I am focusing on my emails
         * which I received yesterday after I left my desk, to make sure that i am note missing anything
         * from yesterday. Then i am openning my jira board, basically getting ready for my daily stand
         * up which occurs at 10am everyday. At stand up as a team we discuss what we did yesterday what
         * we are working on right now and more importantly if there is anything that holding me to do my
         * job, impediments. After stand up i go back to my desk and depending on which part of sprint our
         * team is my tasks differ. lets say if it is early sprint i would participate in sprint planning
         * meeting where we go over the user stories and pointing them. also I would work on maintaining my
         * framework, participate in test scenario reviews. towards the mid sprint where the code is being
         * released i would complete my automation and start execution. if it is end of the sprint I would be
         * busy for getting reports ready and participate in demo meeting. Also I we have retro meeting at the
         * end of the sprint. Every Tuesdays we have lunch and learn session where i share my coding and automation
         * experience with my fellow manual testers, also every Friday we have code review meeting among automation
         * testers of the project. As I am Java certificate I also participate in developers code review meetings
         * just to get an idea f the code. So this
         * is basically my day, oh i actually forgot about coffee :slightly_smiling_face: i do not start my day without
         * a cup of coffee.
